# Below are a list of hostnames that are blocked by Focus
#
# Lines that start with a '#' are ignored, so you can comment stuff out easily
#
# You only have to specify a base hostname, so 'twitter.com' applies to both 'api.twitter.com' and 'www.twitter.com'
#
# The sites are organized into categories. You'll likely want to remove sites that you find productive and add more sites that you find distracting
#
# NOTE: After editing this file you'll have to toggle Focus for the changes to become active.
